# Hangman

This project is a simple game of Hangman played entirely in the command line. The user guesses a random secret word generated by the program. The player may guess one letter at a time or the entire word. There is load/save game functionality implemented with YAML.

Among the apparent skills required to complete this project, I learned to:
* Reinforce my understanding of **object-oriented programming**
* Decide when to utilize **class methods**
* Write simple **documentation** for each class/module
* Use private methods to **encapsulate** instance methods
* **Serialize** a class in order to save it to a text file
* **Unserialize** a file in order to use it in the program
* Create a **script** (`extract_game_words.rb`) to write a filtered list of words to a new file (`5desk.txt` -> `game_words.txt`)
